# PICSimLab SVG library to use with Pcbdraw

These files are used by the [PICSimLab](https://github.com/lcgamboa/picsimlab) with [PcbDraw](https://github.com/yaqwsx/PcbDraw) to draw boards and parts.

Use: 
	`pcbdraw plot  --margin 0 -s lib/picsimlab.json -l lib/ pcbfile.kicad_pcb output.svg` 
	
The SVG outlines were obtained from the repository [KICAD 3d models SVG](https://github.com/lcgamboa/PcbDrawKicad)
